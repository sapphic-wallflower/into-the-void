            It's been a couple decades since they've closed this place down. I came here with my family a lot when I was a kid. It's hard to remember what it used to be among the decay and disrepair. The only thing that stood out was the light pink and teal tiling on the floor. A distinct colour pallet of the '90s; the last time this place saw any prosperity.
        </p>
        <p>
            It's a surprise they haven't demolished it yet. You could practically smell the mould and decaying bodies from the sidewalk. While all the big chain stores and kiosks had long cleared out, there were still sales going on. Real estate, consumables, medical equipment, you name it. But none of that is why I found myself here again.
        </p>
        <p>
            The power was cut off years ago, so the residents set up make-shift floodlights. As much as you could consider a flashlight taped to the wall a “floodlight”. Making my way down the halls, avoiding the massive holes in the floor, I found what I was looking for.
        </p>
        <p>
            The arcade had been thoroughly looted. Cabinet screens were smashed in, pinball machines tipped over, joysticks broken and littered across the floor. However, one machine remained in perfect condition, against all odds. I was in awe. It was also the only thing in the entire arcade getting power. Pushing past the rubble and debris, I made my way to the dimly lit machine.
        </p>
        <p>    
            This arcade machine was unique to our arcade. It was built by a woman who used to live around here. She went missing soon after the mall went out of business. Everyone assumed her family moved out of town, since they owned the arcade. We used to gather around her and watch her play for hours. She told us that if anyone had beaten her high score, she'd give us a prize. Well, all these years later, I came to do just that.
        </p>
        <p>    
            Flashing across the screen was the leaderboard over the top of a preview of the game. Simple by today's standards, the premise was to defeat as many enemies as you could following a rhythm. The more enemies you killed, the faster they would come. The main sprite was modelled after the creator's dog. The enemies were generic looking authority figures. You know, things dogs would be afraid of. Mail carriers, animal control, teenage boys with skulls on their shirts.
        </p>
        <p>    
            It took me hours of playing before I came anywhere close to my high score from when I was a kid. Finally, I scratched the surface of the leaderboard, knocking one of my old high scores off. Shortly after, I moved up a few more spaces, overtaking some old friends from high school. Still, very far from coming anywhere near the top score.
        </p>
        <p>    
            I was running out of money, and was starting to get frustrated. I was so close, but I was making a scene. Not only that, but I didn't want any of the vagrants in the mall knowing I had money to put into an arcade machine, nor did I really want the pressure of an audience. Taking a deep breath, I put in another quarter. Five minutes of perfect play, second place. It was time.
        </p>
        <p>    
            I put in another quarter, and shook my sore wrists. I didn't blink for what felt like my entire life. I didn't look at the score counter or how far I'd gotten. I had to do this. It was weighing on my mind for too long. I couldn't stop thinking about her. Every single day, I would look at our yearbook, thinking about where she could have gone. I just wanted to be close to her again in the only way I knew was possible; on the leaderboard of a game she created. I was obsessed.
        </p>
        <p>    
            And finally, after eight hours of standing in the same spot, I finally surpassed her score. I stood there staring, wondering where my “special prize” was, as if anything was ever going to come of it. Flashing on the screen, the new leaderboard was littered with my three initials in the top ten spots, aside from second place. I felt like I could die at that moment.
        </p>
        <p>    
            I regained my composure and decided it was time to go. The thing I wanted most was closure, but even after all that, I still miss her. There was no way getting a high score in a video game was going to change anything, right?
