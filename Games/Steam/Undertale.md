## Summary
There was always a lot of hype for me to play this game amongst my inner circle. The people close to me have always been eagar and excited for me to play this one, and I figured since I had nothing else going on, might as well give it a shot. I'm hoping that the massive hype, and semi-spoliers don't ruin the game for me. Dispite living on the internet, I don't know much about this game. 

## First Impressions
It's a very story-heavy game. There's a lot of things for you to take in, and you'll probably miss something neat on your first playthrough. The puzzles are mostly simple. The battle mechanic can be a little hard to get used to, but it's not very punishing for getting hit. It gives you some typical RPG options, and even if you don't play that genre, it's barebones enough to figure out during your first battle. There's an option to fight, do an action, use an item, or flee/spare the enemy. For whatever reason, for my entire playthrough, I was compelled to figure out how to spare everyone, as you have to figure out a mini-puzzle for each different enemy. 

## Getting Into It
It took me a little bit of time to warm up to this game. I didn't think I was going to enjoy it based on my first two hours, but the quirkiness of the game has made me smile more times than I realized. As you go through the game, there's a mix of lore, and silly moments. There's never too much of one for any given amount of time, they're typically split evenly between silly and serious. 

## Final Thoughts


## Completion
All you really can do is complete this game. There's no achievements, and you essentially playthrough the gam to complete it. I wouldn't say beating it is completing it, but you'll know once you've done it.
