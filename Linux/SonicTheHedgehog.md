## Summary
To explain the platform, this was the Taxman&Stealth remake. I originally bought this on iOS, but I played it on Linux with the [decompilation](https://github.com/Rubberduckycooly/Sonic-1-2-2013-Decompilation) for Sonic 1, 2, and CD. 

The game is a bit rough to come back and play, but it's certainly more fun than some other retro games. I had a good time playing this. You get to play as all the characters in the Taxman&Stealth version, which is the only real way to play the game as of writing this. 

## Gameplay
It's classic Sonic, except for having the spin dash in this version. It doesn't do much, so I avoided using it. The level design is unique, it's what you'd expect from a classic Sonic game. You have your multi-level gameplay loop, with the top, middle, and bottom levels. Top being easier, but harder to platform, bottom being more enemy dense, middle being a mix of the two. 

## Difficulty
It can be straight up unfair at times. The way the levels are designed can be painfully obvious they were trying to extend how long it takes to beat this very short game. That's how old games were designed, so how much fault can be attributed here? While unfair, and sometimes frustrating, it maintained its level of being a "frustratingly fun" experience. There are moments that can challenge your ability as a platform player, even up to today's standards.

## Completion
Completing this game boils down to getting all the chaos emeralds as all four characters. Sonic & Tails, Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles. All this means is you'll be playing the game four times. Each character may be different, but the level layout is the same, and never changes. Do you like the first Sonic game? Do you want an excuse to play the game more? Might as well complete it. Otherwise, maybe check out Sonic 2, CD, or 3&K instead.
