## Summary
I couldn't stomach setting up an emulator for this experience, and I believe Sonic 3 A.I.R. to be the definitive way to play the game currently. The plethora of settings you're given makes this game unmatched. 

This game is a massive step up from Sonic 1, 2, & CD. Everything is better, from the gameplay, to the sound, to the level design. The levels still do have their flaws, which goes with the nature of when this game was made.

## Gameplay

My first version of this review had a breakdown of how I felt about every level. The more I played the game, and the more I read my reviews, I agreed with them less and less. Every levels is unqiue in its own way, and you'll find a way to love or dislike something on every level, but you'll come to love everything about this game. Each play through makes you get better at the game, and you can see that translate in real time. You will see yourself get progressively better, and that's something rare in video games I feel. 

I'm not going to describe each level to you, I implore you to go play them yourself. Some levels have flaws, but they're some of the most fun platforming you can experience in gaming, even in [current year].

## Difficulty
### **Sonic & Tails**
This is the default expereience. I underutilized Tails, but it doesn't feel like I missed anything substatial by not using her. I killed bosses faster, but she got me killed a few times due to hitting the boss before me, and hitstun. Gifts and curses, I suppose. 

### **Sonic**
Pretty standard. You aren't going to reach any of the special things that you need to have/be Tails to get, but out of sight, out of mind, right? 

### **Tails**
Playing as Tails made the game so easy, but I found this playthrough the most fun. I was able to use my knowledge of the game up until this point, as well as her amazing mobility to play the game in the most overpowered way possible. I had a great time with this one. 

### **Knuckles**
When I was a kid, I had no idea that Knuckles levels were remixed versions of the original levels. I thought they were the same levels, but you played as Knuckles. I quickly learned that, no only were they remixed, they were much more difficult. During my first playthrough with Knuckles, I got repeadedly irritated with the design of the levels. The bosses were also harder, shooting out more projectiles than their Sonic & Tails counterparts. The final boss, however, was much more easy than the original Death Egg fight with Eggman. 

### **Knuckes & Tails**
More or less the same thoughts as my thoughts on Knuckles. Second play through as Knuckles was easy, and Tails mostly just got in the way.

## Completion
I absolutely recommend going for full completion of this game. It takes less than 30 hours to do, and seeing & feelings yourself get better to achieve those multiple saves files makes you feel good. When I started, I thought I was just going to beat the game and call it there. I ended up not only completing the game, I went back and did a bunch of time trials to see how fast I could beat each level. This is such a fun experience, even if you aren't a mega platformer fan.

Funny big head Knuckles. Sign dropped on my head.

A lot of the time, Tails would go in and hit the boss before me, making me fall to my death.
