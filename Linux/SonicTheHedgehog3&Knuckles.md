## Summary
I couldn't stomach setting up an emulator for this experience, and I believe Sonic 3 A.I.R. to be the definitive way to play the game currently. The plethora of settings you're given makes this game unmatched. 

This game is a massive set up from Sonic 1, 2, & CD. Everything is better, from the gameplaying, to the sound, to the level design. The levels still do have their flaws, which goes with the nautre of when this game was made.
