## Summary
I couldn't stomach setting up an emulator for this experience, and I believe Sonic 3 A.I.R. to be the definitive way to play the game currently. The plethora of settings you're given makes this game unmatched. 

This game is a massive step up from Sonic 1, 2, & CD. Everything is better, from the gameplay, to the sound, to the level design. The levels still do have their flaws, which goes with the nature of when this game was made.

## Gameplay

Originally, when I started writing this review, I was going to review each level, and each of the special stages. Every time I completed a play through, I felt differently about each level, and decided that writing my first impressions make no sense. I stopped agreeing with each of my level specific reviews the more I looked at them. I started to realize that I was playing a SEGA game. I don't think I've ever played a SEGA game that was anything other than okay my first time through. I kept getting better at the game, and the levels started making more sense. 

## Difficulty
### **Sonic & Tails**
This is the default expereience. I underutilized Tails, but it doesn't feel like I missed anything substatial by not using her. I killed bosses faster, but she got me killed a few times due to hitting the boss before me, and hitstun. Gifts and curses, I suppose. 

### **Sonic**
Pretty standard. You aren't going to reach any of the special things that you need to have/be Tails to get, but out of sight, out of mind, right? 

### **Tails**
Playing as Tails made the game so easy, but I found this playthrough the most fun. I was able to use my knowledge of the game up until this point, as well as her amazing mobility to play the game in the most overpowered way possible. I had a great time with this one. 

### **Knuckles**
When I was a kid, I had no idea that Knuckles levels were remixed versions of the original levels. I thought they were the same levels, but you played as Knuckles. I quickly learned that, no only were they remixed, they were much more difficult. During my first playthrough with Knuckles, I got repeadedly irritated with the design of the levels. The bosses were also harder, shooting out more projectiles than their Sonic & Tails counterparts. The final boss, however, was much more easy than the original Death Egg fight with Eggman. 

### **Knuckes & Tails**
More or less the same thoughts as my thoughts on Knuckles. Second play through as Knuckles was easy, and Tails mostly just got in the way.

## Completion
I can see the appeal of wanting to complete this game. It has a clear direction of what 100% would look like, esepcially if you play A.I.R.. It's hard for me to recommend it personally, as this game sat on my backlog for so long, it kept me from playing anything else. This is mostly a me problem, but if you can't start a game until you finish the previous, and you're not a die hard platformer fan, you might consider beating this and moving on. I slowly chipped away at this until I completed it, which took me a few months. The sheer scope of this game is daunting, since it's two games built into one.

Funny big head Knuckles. Sign dropped on my head.

A lot of the time, Tails would go in and hit the boss before me, making me fall to my death.
