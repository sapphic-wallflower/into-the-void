# Cost
-  **Linux** is completely free. **macOS** requires you to own an Apple computer, or you can pay **Microsoft** $140 for **Windows**. 
-  While this isn't specific to **Linux** itself, there's no "app store" that'll cost you any money to download things from. With **Linux** comes the Free & Open Source (FOSS) mentality that gives you options to use your computer to the fullest ability without necessarily having the funds to do so. No one owns **Linux**, therefore, there's no reason to make an app store to get a kick back from. 
-  Since "no one owns **Linux**", this also means there's no huge marketing team trying to squeeze every dollar out of you and control what you see so you're the most likely possible to spend money. More on this in Privacy & Security.

# Customization
- You have a lot of options when it comes to **distributions** on **Linux**. There is only *one* **macOS**, and typically, only one **Windows** experience. You can pick anything from a completely hand-held experience to thrown right into a terminal window with nothing but the command line. There's tons of options for anywhere in between as well.
- (unfinished) desktop, color scheme, file manager, no limits
- (unfinished) stable, unstable, bleeding edge, you have choice

# Ownership
- Your computer isn't going to force you to update anything you don't want to, you choose when that happens and what gets updated. Everything from security updates, to drivers, to applications that you use daily. All of this can be displayed within the terminal, or in a graphical package manager depending on your **distribution**. 

# Privacy & Security
- (unfinished) no phoning home, no telemetry, no ads
- (unfinished) overall greater security 

# Usability 
- (unfinished) stable, your OS will never crash forcing you to restart, but your desktop env still can
- With all the moving parts of any operating system, **Linux** stays mostly out of your way. There won't be huge OS level programs eating massive amount of resources and slowing down your computer. Even massively loaded **distributions** can sit under 500 MB of RAM, reviving the life of older hardware, no longer bogged down by loaded operating systems. 
- **Linux distributions** themselves take a minuscule amount of resources. While this doesn't seem like anything that matters with storage sizes these days, it means you can run **Linux** off a USB device and take your setup with you on the go, should you choose to do that. 
- **macOS** and **Windows** don't allow you to run their OS off of anything other than a typical hard drive. USB booting isn't allowed, based on their EULA. They have active measures to stop you from doing that. While you normally wouldn't want to run anything like an OS from a USB, the option is there, and a very effective kill-switch for activists, or really anyone who needs to have that privacy for any reason.
