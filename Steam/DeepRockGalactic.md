## Summary
This game has easily become my favorite online multiplayer game of all time. It's extremely fun, no matter what you end up doing. If you want to play alone, with friends, or with a bunch of random people. The dynamics between all the settings, levels, weapons, and weapon modifiers make every drop unique and fun to play.

## Gameplay
- Space Rig: This is where you'll be when you aren't in the game. There are a handful of things to do here, and it's a nice hub world to hang out in while you wait to drop into the world. You can buy brew before the match to buff your character in a few various ways. Some of those include faster movement speed while carrying heavy objects, massive bonus gold drops, various upgrades to your pickaxe, and more. In the same area, there's a basketball-like barrel kicking game, which is linked to a couple of achievements. There are some hidden things on the Space Rig for you to find as well, so keep an eye out for those.

- Characters: All the characters in the game have an important role to play, that only they can accomplish. Some people will say that “X class is underpowered”, and “Y class is overpowered”, but after playing them all for an equal amount of time, I found myself saying “Wow, I really wish I was playing XYZ class”. They're extremely well-balanced, and when you find that right character for you, it'll feel like they can do anything. It's a fun bit of exploration, and I encourage you to play every class. Don't get stuck in the one-trick pony camp until you've got a ton of hours under your belt.

- Weapons: I have the same opinion about weapons. Everyone can get really opinionated about what's best, what isn't great, etc. but all the weapons in the game can fill a very specific role or just feel fun for you to play with. Even at the highest level of play, there isn't a weapon that can't deal with whatever the game throws at you, especially with the right weapon overclock. An overclock is a modifier to your weapon you can unlock doing various things. They can completely change how the gun feels, what it does, or just give a simple upgrade to the ammo count and damage. There are so many overclocks to find and experiment with. They aren't all created equal, but there aren't any that'll just make the weapon unusable. Again, don't get stuck in a mindset of “This is what I will use forever, I will never use anything else”. Please experiment with weapons and the overclocks that go with them. You'll have such a better time playing the game.

- Assignments: During your first 100 levels in the game, you'll get consistent assignments to unlock cosmetics and new weapons. After a while, you'll stop getting new assignments for those, and you'll only get two for your weeklies, and then every time you need to promote your character. There isn't much to say about them. I haven't really seen any of the early ones for a long time now, but they're a great tool for easing a new player into the weapons.

- Weekly Challenges: Every week, you'll get access to assignments that'll give you said cores to unlock overclocks. There's a deep dive, and an elite deep dive. They're essentially three missions back to back that carry Nitra from the last match onto the next. Each drop increases the difficulty, so you'll need to preserve your Nitra as best you can, so you don't run out when things get tough. The normal deep dive is quite easy. It's most a time sink once you get better at the game. The elite deep dive poses the most challenging task in the game, and you have to do it weekly. The other two weeklies are assignments that give you some cores, and materials. I assume these are for people who don't have time to commit to the deep dives, but want to get some bonuses each week too.

- The Map: This is where you'll be able to see all the available missions. There are eight zones, but only five are available. They rotate every 30 minutes. From here, you can see what type of mission it is, what modifiers they have, and how long & complex they'll be. The game clearly tells you how complex and how long missions are going to be, as well as any modifications to the enemies or bonuses to the world. It can be a nice mix-up in the already ever-changing world of Hoxxes. I won't spoil all the modifiers here because they're fun to explore and learn about on your own, but there's enough to keep the game interesting indefinitely. 

- Events: Once you've dropped into these maps, there's a chance that you'll get some type of bonus events. Those blank cores that you've been getting from the weeklies can be cashed in after completing these events. You put a key into the matrix core, and it'll activate the event. There are a few different types, so keep an eye out as you play. Aside from those, there's also rare enemy spawns, such as the bulk detonator, and the prospector. In the future, there will be even more events, but at the time of writing this, those are the majority that you'll find. You'll always want to do these, as they give bonus loot, bonus experience, and even weapon modifications in the form of overclocks. 

## Difficulty
- Hazard 1 & 2: I don't really see a point in these difficulties. They can't be aimed at anyone other than children, but I think that would be insulting towards the skill level of children. Playing on these even as a new player will gimp your expectations of the game, and give you a bad first impression.

- Hazard 3: This is where the game starts to be a game. You'll want to play the game on this difficulty for most of your learning experience. The difficulty is just right for new players, and people who want to casually enjoy the game after a long day. No sweat, but still challenging. 

- Hazard 4: Once you get more experienced at the game, this is the default mode you'll be playing on. Anything less will be too easy. It'll eventually turn into your warm up games before jumping into Hazard 5. It's the perfect amount of challenge where things aren't unfair yet.

- Hazard 5: The quintessential unfair difficulty. Everything is beefed up, runs faster, and does more damage. It's a very fun experience, but if you get people on your team who constantly go down, it becomes a medic simulator. It's very chaotic at times, especially if you throw in some modifiers to make the enemies even harder. Personally, this is the only mode that's fun for me anymore. 

## Completion
It's hard to suggest sitting down and completing this game. I would say that if you're really dead set on completing it (all achievements), I'd recommend you not focus on doing the final achievement. The final achievement essentially requires you to play every class and promote them seven times. Obviously, it took me almost 400 hours to do that, and I was really focusing on the double experience missions. There's also some dispute between what completion actually is. For a sane person, it would be getting all the achievements. For the more insane, you'd want to go for all cosmetics, which would most likely take you well into the thousand-hour mark. The cargo crates have a ton of content in them, plus getting all the weapon modifications seems endless. It's also a game that's still getting constant updates. They haven't ever added more achievements, but they will almost certainly be consistently adding more cosmetics. Truly a task for the insane to keep up with all of that.

## Media Gallery

I always hated it when people did this. When I first started playing, I thought it was funny. 500 hours in, I find myself cleaning up after everyone like I'm their mom or something.
