## Summary
This was one of the handful of childhood games I put on my backlog to really see to the end, based on how much of a good time I had with them when I was younger. There are tons of ups and downs when it comes to this game. Although I haven't played a lot of fighting games, this is one of the few games I've played that has a unique feeling single player story. Other than that, the longer I played this game, and the longer I went for full completion, the more and more I disliked it. 

## Gameplay
- Dragon World: To me, this is the main way to play the game. It's formatted in a board game style, where you can move your piece around the board and attack others. You can also find buffs, capsules, and money above and underground. In my opinion, playing through this once or twice is the best way to experience this game, it's fun to discover where things are and how you combine your teammates to make your character as strong as possible. 
- Dueling/Training: You most likely won't play these much if you're coming to the game now. They're for playing against your friends, computers, or just practicing against stationary targets. They're pretty useless because the AI for these feel like a beta version of what the game truly plays like. 
- World Tournament: This is a tournament style mode where you can vs another player as well as computer opponents. It's mostly to grind out money to buy capsules you want from the capsule shop, there isn't a ton of depth to it. 
- Capsules: You can unlock these while playing through the story mode, or buying them from the capsule shop. They're a nice way to customize your character and get stronger over time. There's some that are hard to unlock, which make your character insanely strong. They're fun to mix and match, finding out which combo is the best, or the most fun to play with. 
- Babadi's Spaceship: After beating the story for the first time, and collecting all the Dragon Balls, you get this as an option to wish for. It unlocks four mini-games that you can play to unlock capsules and even some new characters related to Babadi. The mini-games are very... okay. Not the most engaging and won't hold your attention for too long, but a decent addition to the game. 
- Nitpicks: The game is extremely inconsistent with conveying information. In some modes, you can read what capsules do, while in others, you can't. This is particularly annoying in World Tournament mode, where you need to customize your character each time. Furthermore, while a ton of characters have the same ability, they all do them at different speeds. Some do the ability so slowly, that it can be instantly blocked by the opponent. 

## Difficulty
- Easy: No idea why this in the game. It turns the whole experience into not a video game, but a poor recreation of the anime.
- Normal / Hard: They both feel the same. It's not a very challenging experience, but I'd recommend playing on hard at most to get a feeling for how the game should be played. 
- Very Hard / Z / ZZ: If you really want to hate yourself, or hate the game, give it a shot. This is where I started to realize that this was another budget game pushed out the door. I always wondered why Bandai didn't add Budokai 2 in their Budokai Remaster collector's edition, but I now have a pretty good suspicion. The game is broken, the characters have no balance at all, and the only way to win these modes is to play very safe, only using one or two extremely popular characters. The side characters feel like they were thrown in at the last second, but that would account for 30 of the 34 characters. 

## Completion
- I strongly advise against attempting this. There's no clear indication of what you missed, so you'll be retracing your steps doing the same thing over and over again with no clear indication of if what you're doing is correct. You should play more than just beating it, but I wouldn't get too crazy with it. At most, beat the game on hard, play the mini-games in Babadi's Spaceship a handful of times, and do a World Tournament on Adept with all of your favorite characters. Don't try to get all the capsules, and certainly don't play the game on Z or ZZ.
