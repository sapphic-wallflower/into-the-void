<!------------------------------ Why? ------------------------------>

        <h2>Why Clickpocalypse 2?</h2>
    </div>
    
    <div class="content-box">
        <p>
            Back in the early days of the App Store, there were more conventional options to sort apps.
            I used to find new and unique indie games was the option to sort by recently updated.
            That's how I originally found myself playing this game back on my iPhone 5c.
            Trying to play on mobile these days will result in the game not working, but the browser version will always be functional.
        </p>
    </div>

<!------------------------------ UI & Theme ------------------------------>
    <div class="content-title">
        <h2>User Interface & Theme</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="content-box">
        <p>
            The only way to interact with the game is through the UI, since you don't move the characters.
            Since it's a UI-based game, you'd expect the UI to be perfectly thought out.
            Unfortunately, it leaves a lot to be desired.
            There is so much information presented, and almost none of it's useful.
            The game provides more details on player and enemy stats than a traditional RPG, but gives you fewer ways to interact with it than an on-rails shooter.
        </p>
        <p>
            The programmer art and the way the sprites slide around the screen is charming.
        </p>
    </div>

<!------------------------------ Gameplay ------------------------------>
    <div class="content-title">
        <h2>Gameplay</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="content-box">
        <p>
            As stated in the previous section, the gameplay is all in the menus.
            When you start a run, you're able to pick between eleven different characters, and your party can be up to five.
            Some classes have synergy with each other, so it's fun to see which classes work well together.
            The downside is, you're not making a party too often, as you have to complete an entire run before picking a new group.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once you have your party picked out, it's time to clear some dungeons.
            As you go through, you level up your characters, and increase their stats.
            Each class has one or more abilities that you can unlock, providing some utility, attack bonus, or defensive bonus.
            For example, the rogue has an ability that detects treasures and picks up all loot on the ground instantly.
            The priest provides a ton of useful buffs to your party.
            The tank taunts and groups all the enemies together.
        </p>
        <p>
            Finally, the interactive part of the game.
            As you kill monsters, you rack up potions, kills, new gear, scrolls, and money.
            The scrolls allow you to attack the enemies using off-screen abilities, such as a rain of fire that does AoE, a spider web that keeps them in place, and arrows that bounce between enemies.
            You also get potions that benefit you in some way, such as make you walk faster, drop better money or loot, and have a higher chance of spawning a boss.
            Other than that, you use the money to buy new castles to farm, and kills to upgrade your character, retire weak monsters, and bring in stronger monsters.
        </p>

<!------------------------------ Loop ------------------------------>
    <div class="content-title">
        <h2>Gameplay Loop</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="content-box">
        <p>
            The best part about this game is that it plays itself.
            The offline progress is just good enough to progress, while the active gameplay helps you get through the game faster.
            It's a pretty low-effort game that you can play when you want to, and still progress. 
            Figuring out the class, potion, and scroll combinations is extremely fun, and you can find yourself figuring out the best combo to complete a run as fast as possible.
        </p>
    </div>

<!------------------------------ Conclusion ------------------------------>
    <div class="content-title">
        <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="content-box">
        <p>
            Easily one of the top ten incremental games ever made.
            I know I said the game overloads you with information, but if you wanted, you could really master this game using it.
            How much time you sink into this game is completely up to you, but it still limits itself, unlike other incremental games that go on forever.
            The charm and effort put into the game makes it a cozy tab to have opened for the better part of a year.
        </p>

<!------------------------------ Completionist ------------------------------>
    <div class="content-title">
        <h2>Should you complete Clickpocalypse 2?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="content-box">
        <p>
            Something I avoided talking about until now are the achievements.
            These are a key selling point of this game if you're a completionist.
            They're well laid out, and feel like they had some thought put into them.
            If you actively work towards getting all the achievements, you'll get the last few at the same time.
            There aren't any that require you to mindlessly grind well after you've done everything else.
            Absolutely, everyone should have this game on their backlog.
