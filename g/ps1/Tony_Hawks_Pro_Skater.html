        <h2>Why Tony Hawk's Pro Skater?</h2>
    </div>
    
    <div class="content">
        <p>
            I remember playing this game as a kid, specifically because it had a blue cartridge on the Nintendo 64.
            Tony Hawk games have always been fun for me, up until a point. 
            I never got very far in this game, because I had siblings who wanted to skate around in free skate, and I wasn't that great at video games yet.
            Back when I was a kid, I was less focused on beating and completing video games in favour of having fun.
        </p>

            The amount of time and effort that went into picking the soundtrack for this game shows.
            Every song choice feels like something an actual skater would listen to.
            THPS single-handedly introduced millions of people to ska music in all its glory.
            It's not just video game music, they're all songs that I would listen to on their own.
            A solid mixtape for an actual skate session. 
        </p>
        <p>
            It's difficult to comment on the graphics of the game, since I have so much experience with newer games now.
            As you can imagine, the graphics are very 90s.
            There are many characters to choose from, but they all look the same.
            All the levels have the same poor render distance, too.
            Luckily, it doesn't detract from the game.
            There was a setting in the emulator I was using, DuckStation, to increase the graphics of the game, which I did elect to use.
            I kept the 4:3 ratio though, no stretching here!

<!------------------------------ Gameplay Mechanics ------------------------------>
    <div class="content-title">
        <h2>Gameplay Mechanics</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="content">
        <p>
            THPS is an arcade skateboarding simulator.
            You skate around doing challenges by doing tricks for a high score, collecting or destroying objects, and compete in skate competitions.
            There isn't much to this game, it really is that simple.
            Cruise around each level on your board finding secrets and doing your objectives.
            You get more than enough variation doing similiar challenges across each level.
        </p>
        <p>
            Before you start playing, you're able to pick what character you want to play.
            These are real people whose likeness were put into the game.
            Just like in the real world, their skills in-game match what they can do in real life.
            Street skaters are good at doing street tricks, and very skaters are good at doing vert tricks, naturally.
            As you play through the levels, you're able to even out these stats to being more even as you get to the end.
            But the tricks you can perform with these characters will always match what they can do in real life.
            It's a neat touch I never noticed as a kid.
        </p>
        <p>
            Being a PS1/N64 game, it can be a bit... rough.
            Obviously, it's the first game in the serious, so, naturally, you'd expect it to be.
            The render distance and frame rate can get pretty bad on some levels.
            When trying to get high score combos, the game slowing down can be a problem.
            Some competition levels get intense, coming down to the final trick.
            Imagine how frustrating it would be if you bailed because the game buffered an input you thought you were doing at that moment.
        </p>
    </div>

<!------------------------------ Replayability ------------------------------>
    <div class="content-title">
        <h2>Replayability</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="content">
        <p>
            Most of what you do in Pro Skater is replaying the same levels.
            Since you only get two minutes to complete the challenges in each level, you'll end up playing them multiple times.
            After you beat the game, you unlock two generic police officers to play as.
            They're neat, but the gameplay doesn't change at all.
            Each character you beat the game as, you get their sponsor tape.
            A sponsor tape is something you send to a skate company for them to fund your skating escapades as a celebrity of sorts.
            Unfortunately, no gameplay changes and no new levels.
            Just some videos and a couple of new characters.

<!------------------------------ Final Thoughts ------------------------------>
    <div class="content-title">
        <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="content">
        <p>
            Tony Hawk's Pro Skater is a fun time waster.
            It won't take you long to get through the game.
            The unserious nature of the game makes it a great candidate to play between longer, more involved games.
            Seeing where the series started in comparison to where it ended up is interesting.
            It does suffer from being old, however.
            Prepare to have iron patience with the controls.

<!------------------------------ Completionist & Master ------------------------------>
    <div class="content-title">
        <h2>Should you complete or master Tony Hawk's Pro Skater?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="content">
        <p>
            I went back and forth on this question myself.
            I had a discussion with my friends about what's considered completion here.
            Each character unlocks a sponsor tape when you collect all the tapes and medals with them.
            Nothing changes between characters besides a couple of stats.
            It's absurd to ask someone to complete the game 14 times for a simple sponsor tape to consider it completed.
            You can also simply beat the game with a character by not collecting all the tapes and medals.
            For that reason, I say completion is defined by collecting all tapes and medals on one character.
            Mastering would be doing that with all characters.
            Should you complete it?
            Yeah.
            You probably will just by playing the game.
            Should you master it?
            There are so many better games you could be spending your time on.
            Even Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 is infinitely better than the first game.
