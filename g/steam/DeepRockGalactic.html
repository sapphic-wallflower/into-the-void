	<h2>Summary</h2>
		<p>
			Around the time I got into Deep Rock, I was in a slump.
			I didn't know what game I was going to play next after completing all the Halo games.
			While talking with a friend, Felicity, she suggested I try out Deep Rock.
			We had talked about completing games, and how we handle multiplayer games, which is how Deep Rock game up.
			It became my go-to game to play whenever I needed something to from November 2021 until January 2023. 
		</p>
	<h2>First Impressions</h2>
		<p>
			Loading up the game for the firs time, you're greeted with a tutorial.
			It's a bit shallow, it could do a better job explaining some mechanics.
			Luckily, it's a game you play mostly from a friends recommendation, so they should be around to help you with questions.
			When I started the tutorial, I didn't understand how to move past the spwan room, and tried to dig into a wall.
			I later found out there's specific dirt patches you're supposed to go through.
		</p>
		<p>
			After the tutorial, you'll be dropped into the hub; the Space Rig.
			From here, you'll navigate the pre-mission menus, such as the mission table, the assignment board, and your employee terminal, where you can customize your loadout.
			There are a few other menus you'll unlock along the way, as well as minigames and achievements to find while your friends are "making food" between missions.
			A lot of effort was put into the Space Rig, and while most people could see it as a means to an end for mission selection, it serves as a way to disconnect the combat from the customization.
		</p>
		<p>
			Jumping into the mission aspect of the game, there's a lot to be said.
			You have the option to switch between four classes that all fill specific roles.
			You can tell that the generation of the maps and enemies are finely tuned around these four classes that I would be shocked if they found a way to fit a new class into the game.
			Dropping into the mission, you'll be expected to do a primary and secondary objective, as well as any events that pop up along the way.
			Throughout the mission, enemies will come harass you in small groups, as well as periodic "hordes", where they spawn indefinitely for a few minutes.
			Outside of combat, you'll need to explore the cave and find minerals on the wall. 
			You can use these minerals to buy upgrades and cosmetics outside of the mission, or the incase of "Nitra", resupply your ammo during the mission.
			Once you've done everything you need to do, you call the droppod back, and head up to the Space Rig.
			It does drop in a random spot, however, so you'll need to fight your way to the end with constant harassment coming to get you.

## Getting Into It
 Each class gets three primary weapons, three to four secondaries, and three grenades. These tools, along with overclocks - a way to modify your base weapons - will allow people to experiment with thousands of different weapon combinations to refine their play. 

What good are weapons without maps to play them on? Every map that you load will be different. Some mission types have templates, meaning that some might look the same, but they'll always play out differently. With modifiers on maps, random generations/seeds, machine events, and the plethora of weapons you get, you could get lost in this game for thousands of hours.

There are five difficulties in the game, known as hazards. You can go from hazard one, up to hazard five. For the first two, I wouldn't recommend anyone play on these difficulties, aside from your first few games. Because this is a PvE game only, you're essentially doing nothing but mining. Very little enemies spawn, and when they do, they fall over pretty quickly. Hazard three is great for getting your bearings in the game, as well as playing casually in the background with friends. The game feels like it was meant to be played here. 

Moving up to hazard four, you need to start focusing here. Enemies are faster, stronger, and you can quickly get swarmed and go down. Much like hazard four, hazard five follows the same idea. Stronger, faster, smarter enemies. The main difference here, is that if you mess up even once, you're dead. You have to be playing your best at all times, or you're going to slow down your team, or just straight up lose. Hazard four and five feel very rewarding to play if you can make them your main difficulties; the bonus rewards you get for playing them make it feel worth it when you lose once in a while.

## Final Thoughts
As I said before, Deep Rock has become my favourite multiplayer game of all time. With all the build combinations in the game, you can make every drop feel different. I don't think I'll stop playing this game any time soon. It's become my comfort game that I load up and play whenever I find myself rotating between social media. 

The game is easy enough to where you should be able to carry every game with every build once you've mastered every class. Unfortunately, it's open matchmaking, so people who aren't good at the game can join you. I found this to be the case a majority of the time for me, as I ended up carrying every game. Every time I wanted to try something new, I would end up losing because of the difficulty scaling with more people. I didn't want to drop the difficulty down, and I didn't want to kick everyone I thought was bad based on how many hours they have in the game, so I stuck with my core builds, almost never trying something new. 

## Completion
It's hard to suggest sitting down and completing this game. I would say that if you're really dead set on completing it (all achievements), I'd recommend you not focus on doing the final achievement. The final achievement essentially requires you to play every class and promote them seven times. Obviously, it took me almost 400 hours to do that, and I was really focusing on the double experience missions. There's also some dispute between what completion actually is. For a sane person, it would be getting all the achievements. For the more insane, you'd want to go for all cosmetics, which would most likely take you well into the thousand-hour mark. The cargo crates have a ton of content in them, plus getting all the weapon modifications seems endless. It's also a game that's still getting constant updates. They haven't ever added more achievements, but they will almost certainly be consistently adding more cosmetics. Truly a task for the insane to keep up with all of that.
