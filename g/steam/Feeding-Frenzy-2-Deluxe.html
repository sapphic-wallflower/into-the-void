	<h2>Summary</h2>
		<p>
            On my ongoing quest to beat every PopCap game, I've stumbled upon a game I don't remember playing.
			I do know there's a game that came out before this, but it's not as easy to find and play than the second.
			I can't say I'm too happy with the art style, though.
		</p>
	<h2>First Impressions</h2>
		<p>
            Starting up the game, you're met with the always welcome PopCap branded main screen.
			That's where the enjoyment ends, however. 
		</p>
	<h2>Finding Footing</h2>
		<p>
            There isn't much depth to this game.
			You start out as a small fish, and you have to eat your way to a big fish, starting with fish smaller than you.
			That's the entire game.
			They introduce new fish here and there, but it's just another layer you have to climb.
			There's also some levels where the entire theme is that you're in the dark.
			Sure, I get that it's dark in the depths of the sea, but no one likes dark levels.
		</p>
	<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
		<p>
            It's a fast and easy completion, but you won't have fun.
			If you care about having a full, but meaningless backlog filled with short, horrible games, this is premium.
		</p>
	<h2>Completion Record</h2>
		<p>
            No.
