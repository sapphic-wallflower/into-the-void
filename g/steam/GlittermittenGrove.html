	<h2>Summary</h2>
		<p>
            My girlfriend, Gwen, urged me to play this game after she showed me an older game made by the same developer.
            I didn't understand why until I got into it, apart from it was made by the same person.
            This review will contain major spoilers, so if you have any interest in this game, or Frog Fractions, I suggest checking out any other review on the site. 
		</p>
	<h2>First Impressions</h2>
		<p>
            It's a very bore bones city-building game, based around fairies.
			You need to keep them happy by building them homes & feeding them.
			In turn, they'll collect wood, and set up new buildings for you to cast spells, and mine with explosives.
			I thought the game was going to be over pretty quick as I got the world boarder, but I was very wrong. 
		</p>
	<h2>Finding Footing</h2>
		<p>
            In the game, there are four seasons. 
            During winter, you can't do much with the fairies, as food and tress don't grow.
            The leaves you with the ability to mine, searching for treasure, and crystals. 
            I stumbled upon a door. After clicking that door, my god.
            I never saw the fairies again.
            It took me into an entirely different game.
            It was a text-style RPG.
            I don't mean a text-only input RPG, the graphics were all Unicode symbols.
            You have to run around and solve puzzles, like a 2D Zelda game.
            Slightly disappointed, I learned that I wouldn't get to play the game I thought I was playing anymore. 
		</p>
	<h2>Diving In</h2>
		<p>
            The “TXT GAME” as it's called was a bit frustrating to me to play alone.
            I enlisted the help of my girlfriend to play it with me, and we solved the puzzles together.
            Much like how we got here in the first place, it was heavily based around trolls as well as puzzle solving.
            Throughout the game, you were thrust into other mini-games, which was a neat idea.
            Each mini-game had its own art style.
            It grew on me over time, but through the entire experience, I was a little salty that I was tricked. 
		</p>
	<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
		<p>
            A lot of the movement puzzles with the sword got under my skin, and made me increasingly irritated.
            This is probably more of a personal thing, but I didn't enjoy the puzzles all that much.
            They irritated me while I was doing them, and I felt relived when I was done with them.
            I'm not sure whether I was happy that I'd finished them, or whether I was happy that it was finally over.
            The best part of the game is the ending.
            The final two parts of the game were enjoyable, and made the entire experience worth it. 
		</p>
	<h2>Completion Record</h2>
		<p>
            There isn't a real reason not to complete it.
            Playing through the entire game will net you completion, as there are no achievements or special things to unlock.
            No reasons to play through the game again.
            Short, sweet, easy completionist marker.
