<h2>Summary</h2>
	<p>
            Felicity and my girlfriend, Princess, have wanted me to play this game for a year now.
            I've put it off in favour of other games, but I was able to get to it recently upon completing a large project.
            I was told there was lesbians, which had me excited to see what the game had to offer, since there's a lack of real lesbian experiences in video games.
	</p>
      <p>
            You play as the world travelling older sister to a family of seemingly important people.
            Your mom works for the government to protect the local forests, your dad is an author, and you travel the world.
            This leaves your younger sister in a weird spot, as she's growing up as a punk in a high-standard family.
      </p>
<h2>First Impressions</h2>
	<p>
            The game is a walking simulator, and you're tasked with figuring out what happened to your sister after you come back to an empty house upon finishing your travels.
            The tone is set early on, and doesn't change at any point.
            Walking around an empty house while it's storming outside makes you feel like you're playing a horror game.
	</p>
<h2>Finding Footing</h2>
	<p>
            The walking speed is set to be slow, so you'll really be taking your time to explore everything.
            As you go through, you learn about the family more, and the house you recently moved into.
	</p>
<h2>Diving In</h2>
	<p>
            Your mother works for the forest preservation branch of the government, and she does it well.
            The father, on the other hand, isn't doing too well as an author.
            A publishing company took a risk with his first and second book, and it didn't play out, so they aren't moving forward with him.
            The house was apparently owned by someone who took their life, or there was some sort of accident?
            I couldn't quite follow what happened on my first play through of the game, so I'm not sure what happened with the house.
            You learn all this by walking around, finding notes, audio tapes, and secret rooms throughout.
        </p>
<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
	<p>
            The atmosphere of the game made it challenging for me to get into.
            I don't do well with horror and jump scares, so having the tone of the game feel a pseudo-horror game kept me on edge.
            In general, I feel like the story wasn't for me, despite being a lesbian.
            It was a cute and happy ending, but the “fish out of water” story doesn't feel earned.
            Maybe it was more compelling in 2013, but playing it in 2023, it doesn't do much apart from make me sad overall.
            She “gets the girl”, but has to run away from home to do it.
            I need more than that.
            The default for queer people is to run away from home because it's the only way they can get what they can reach happiness.
	</p>
<h2>Completion Record</h2>
	<p>
            The achievements to completing the game are short and sweet.
            Listening to the developer tracks in the game made me lighten up towards this game.
            They told the story they wanted to tell, and I can accept that.
            The game doesn't need to be <em>for me</em>, and it's still an important story to tell.
            The developer tracks were the most fun part to me, and I'm happy I was able to sit down and hear their insight on the game design.
