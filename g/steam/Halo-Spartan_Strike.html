	<h2>Why Spartan Strike?</h2>
		<p>
			After the release of Halo Wars, I was glad to see they were branching out and making new genres of game under the Halo franchise
			Halo Wars was an RTS, like one of my favourite games, Starcraft, so I had high hopes for Spartan Strike.
			With that said, the first game, <a href="./Halo-Spartan_Assault">Spartan Assault</a>, was a rough experience.
			While I still enjoyed that game, it wasn't the most polished thing in the world.
			Regardless, I can never get enough Halo! (unless it's Halo 5 or Infinite, then stay away from me)
		</p>
	<h2>The UI & Theme</h2>
		<p>
			The UI for this game is basic.
			I believe it was designed to be a mobile game, but at the very least, it has a console game UI.
			It reminds me of the simplicity of older PopCap games, having only a few options.
			This game does have a dedicated achievements menu, and medal tracker, so that was a completionist win right out of the gate.
		</p>
	<h2>The Gameplay</h2>
		<p>
            Spartan Strike is a top-down shooter, where you play as a random Spartan on your quest to beat the Forerunner and Covenant.
			Before you load into each mission, you can spend some credits that allow you to spawn with some power weapons if you find the level too difficult.
			You're also shown your three <strong>Assault Ops</strong> missions, which are mini-objectives you get each level.
			These provide you with the previously mentioned credits.
		</p>
		<p>
			You have all the typical Halo toys here. Two weapons, multiple grenades, a melee, and equipment.
			On the theme of familiarity, each mission will drop you off somewhere, and it's your job to blast through the enemies.
			All the usual suspects are here, from vehicle missions to defend a target missions.
			Occasionally, you'll have to fight a boss, but Halo and bosses have never mixed that well.
			They're never too difficult to not finish on your first try.
		</p>
	<h2>The Loop</h2>
		<p>
            Unfortunately, I don't have much to add in terms of the gameplay loop.
			It's a fairly standard experience, which isn't a bad thing.
			Spartan Strike is a small, bite-sized game that doesn't need a massive complexity to enjoy.
		</p>
	<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
		<p>
            If you like Halo, this is a great game to add to your backlog.
			The short length of the game, and bare minimum variety of content, makes it worth your time.
			It's also a supplemental experience to the Halo lore, if that's something you're into.
		</p>
	<h2>Completion Record</h2>
		<p>
            You can knock this out on a weekend, and it's a rewarding badge to your collection.
			The game clearly lays out what you need to do to complete the game.
			You'll never be confused about what you need to do, or even really look anything up.
			It's a straightforward, easy completion.
