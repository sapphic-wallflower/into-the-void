	<h2>Why Insaniquarium?</h2>
		<p>
			Insaniquarium was my introduction to PopCap Games.
			I remember how I stumbled upon their games in 2005.
			I was in elementary school, looking for free games to play on the school computers.
			This was before schools started to buy invasive software to block websites and spy on students.
			Not only did my entire class fall in love with the game, but my teacher did as well.
			We would all talk about it, put up fish decorations, and write reports on the game.
		</p>
	<h2>The UI & Theme</h2>
		<p>
			Even though this was the first PopCap game I played, it's always refreshing to see the familiar PopCap starting screen.
			Insaniquarium has the usual selection of adventure mode, time trial, high scores, but comes with something special.
			You're given a virtual tank that allows you to buy fish for a screensaver.
			I've tried for many years to make it work on Linux, but I can't seem to make it work consistently.
			I have so many fond memories of the virtual tank, and seeing how much money I could get with the screensaver up.
		</p>
	<h2>The Gameplay</h2>
		<p>
			Starting the adventure mode, the game does a fantastic job introducing you to the mechanics.
			You start out with a single fish, and feeding it allows it to grow.
			As it grows, it drops shells, which act as your currency.
			You can use those shells to buy more fish, upgrades, and the three egg pieces you need to complete the level.
			The upgrades can be anything from being able to drop more food at once, upgrading the quality of the food, and increasing the damage of your ray gun.
			The ray gun allows you to defeat the aliens who come throughout the level to eat your fish.
			Shooting them in the head does double damage, and depending on where you shoot them, they move throughout the tank.
			Losing all your fish means you failed, and need to restart the level.
		</p>
	<h2>The Loop</h2>
		<p>
			After you buy all three egg pieces, you're given a companion to help you in the next level.
			You can only have three, and eventually four, and they all do something different.
			My strategy was to buy the fish that give you money at the start to rush the tank-specific fish.
			Each tank has a special fish that gives you the bulk of your money.
			I felt the best way to win was to use the money making companions to get them out as fast as possible, as they gave more shells than the starter guppies.
			After beating each of the four tanks, you're allowed to play a bonus mini-game gives you shells for your virtual tank.
			Essentially, shells drop from the top of the tank, and they all have different values.
			Clicking the same shell up to ten times doubled the value each time.
		</p>
		<p>
			After beating all stages, you have to beat the final boss.
			Instead of fending off aliens from your guppies and fish, you have to defend all the companions you've gotten throughout your playthrough.
			I've tried for many years to save them all, but I don't think it's possible.
			Either way, once you beat the game, you unlock bonus mode.
			Bonus mode allows you to rack up shells for your virtual tank by playing through the game again, but giving a special stage after every level.
		</p>
	<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
		<p>
			Insaniquarium will always have a special place in my heart.
			I wish we saw more of the game, but after what EA did to PopCap and Plants vs. Zombies, I'm happy for the game to remain as is.
			This game is easy to understand and fun to play.
			I'll always come back and beat this game every couple years or so, and I encourage you to do the same, at least once.
		</p>
	<h2>Completion Record</h2>
		<p>
			Absolutely.
			It's short, it's sweet, and the completion goal is very obvious.
			Completing the game feels like what you're supposed to do.
			I found that beating it alone left me unsatisfied, and it has so much more to offer.
			Add this to your backlog, and complete it.
