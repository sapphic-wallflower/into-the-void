	<h2>Summary</h2>
		<p>
			Peggle Nights is something I had played before, but I decided that I was only going to beat the game.
			I did this after I completed Peggle Deluxe for the first time.
			Since then, it's been taunting me in my <strong>Beaten</strong> category on Backloggery, knowing that one day, I'd come back to finish the job.
			I intially decided I wasn't going to complete it because it was too similar to Peggle.
			Two years later, I want my Peggle fix, so Peggle Nights is on the chopping block.
			For reference, here is my review from early 2020.
		</p>
		<p>
			"After playing through it, it's nice to see they cut some ridiculous level designs, such as the car.
			The new character is probably my favourite in both games.
			I didn't really feel inspired to do the challenges.
			There was less of them, but had the same feel.
			I couldn't muster the desire to want to do the challenges again, because they all felt the exact same."
		</p>
	<h2>First Impressions</h2>
		<p>
			Honestly, it's more of the same <a href="./PeggleDeluxe">Peggle</a>.
			Some people would see this as lazy, but games were just made different back then.
			No new mechanics were added, just more maps. This time around, each level has an "aced" & "all cleared" ribbons.
			This wasn't in the first game, and inflated the play time of this game by a ton.
			"Aced" means you beat the CPU high score, and "all cleared" means you hit all the pegs.
		</p>
	<h2>Finding Footing</h2>
		<p>
			The same characters are still in the game, with the addition of one new character.
			While the characters are the same, they've been remixed to be a sort of "dream" version of themselves.
			A play on the word "night", suggesting they're sleeping, dreaming of their ideal selves.
			It's cute.
			I beat the main adventure mode in 3.3 hours, and went off to the meat of the game. 
		</p>
	<h2>Diving In</h2>
		<p>
			Jumping right into the aced and all clear challenges, I could tell it was going to take a while to complete the game.
			Some levels are painfully hard, and while there is skill involved, there's also an annoying amount of RNG you have to overcome.
			I found myself resetting repeatidly to get the best possible start once I figured out the strategy to perfecting the levels.
			There were times where I would get close to hitting all the pegs in a level, but I accideintally "beat" the level when I was clearly going to clear the map.
			That would follow-up with me getting beyond tilted, and failing to come close to beating the level for another hour.
			They're very challenging, but I did my best to space them out as much as I could to not get burned out of the game.
