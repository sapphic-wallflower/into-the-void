	<h2>Summary</h2>
		<p>
			My girlfriend, Princess, wanted to watch me play this game.
			I've put off playing Portal forever, for no real reason.
			The only reason I'm doing it now, is that I have the very obvious inspiration to do it.
			Other than the memes, my only engagement with Portal was in Killing Floor, but that was a Portal 2 reference. 
		</p>
	<h2>First Impressions</h2>
		<p>
			It's certainly a puzzle game.
			I don't have much to say about it other than that.
			It's exactly what I thought a game named "Portal" would be. 
		</p>
	<h2>Diving In</h2>
		<p>
			Even though I've never played Portal 2, from what I know about it, this seems more like a beta version of that game.
			It feels like this is the demo of a game you'd get before purchasing the actual game.
			You can tell there's some charm there, but it doesn't hit that much.
		</p>
	<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
		<p>
			It feels like a tutorial for another game.
			All the puzzles feel like they're all extremely easy, and none of them took much thought to complete.
			The advanced modes should have been what the default game was; those were actually fun and challenging.
			Most of the difficulty comes in the challenges, which I'll talk about in the completion section.
		</p>
	<h2>Completion Record</h2>
		<p>
			The achievements in this game are a mess.
			Sometimes, they simply don't work.
			I tried to get a few of them multiple times, and it wouldn't register.
			You'll get them all eventually if you want them, but achievements not registering are the bane of any completionist.
			The other achievements in the challenge mode are categorically not fun.
			I haven't talked to anyone at this point who's enjoyed doing them.
			The speedrun challenges are okay until they expect you to utilize glitches to complete them.
			There's no way you'd know about these glitches unless you go out of the game to look them up, either.
