	<h2>Why Slime Rancher?</h2>
		<p>
            Slime Rancher is another game that my current girlfriend, Princess, wanted me to play.
            My first time seeing this game was my sibling, Kudrea, playing it on our newly purchased Xbox One around the mid-10s.
            I thought it was a cute little game, but I didn't understand what was going on, and only watched them play it in passing.
            Fast-forward to 2021, Princess says I need to play the game.
		</p>
	<h2>The UI & Theme</h2>
		<p>
            Seeing the main menu for the first time, I could tell why she wanted me to play it.
            She loves cute things, and seeing the little slimes fall from the sky onto my character and make their cute squishing sounds was delightful.
            After creating my world and loading in, it indeed had a cute aesthetic, with soft colours.
		</p>
        <p>
            In-game, you have a survival crafting style interface.
            You have your standard health and energy bar, item slots at the bottom, and a separate menu for a map.
            You could also switch into a “crafting” mode, removing your item slots for a crafting menu.
        </p>
	<h2>The Gameplay</h2>
		<p>
            As the name of the game suggests, you ranch slimes.
            You're tasked with taking over a farm, after the previous owner goes off on their own adventure.
            To accomplish this, you're given a vacuum that sucks up slimes, items to feed them, and “plorts”, which slimes give you to exchange for currency.
            As you go through the game and make more money, you can expand your farm to hold more slimes and chickens, upgrade your vacuum, boots, and hover pack, and craft machines that give you exclusive crafting materials.
		</p>
    <h3>The Farm</h3>
        <p>
            The basic farm is equipped with your house, a mission board, an economy board where you exchange your plorts, and eight corrals.
            To start, one of those corrals is given for free, leaving you to purchase the other seven.
            On each plot, you can purchase a corral for slimes, a coop for chickens, a garden for fruits or vegetables, a silo to hold items, a pond for a water source, or an incinerator to discard items.
            The main builders also have upgrades that give them more functionality.
            Some include keeping your slimes happier, holding more items, or automatically completing a task related to the building.
        </p>
    <h3>The Farm (cont)</h3>
        <p>
            Once you end up filling the farm, you can expand into four other areas.
            These include The Overgrowth, The Docks, The Grotto, and The Lab.
            These four unlockable areas have something special about them that help you do specific tasks to advance your farm.
            The Overgrowth spawns chickens naturally.
            The Docks give you access to a nice view.
            The Grotto gives you access to a shortcut into another zone.
            The Lab gives you access to machines and the lab, which is the most substantial expansion.
            Each expansion also gives you four or five more corrals to use.
        </p>
    <h3>The Lab</h3>
        <p>
            To use the lab, you input materials, which allows you to craft items.
            You can get new recipes by finding treasure capsules hidden throughout the world.
            Some of these include toys for your pets, extractors to farm exclusive resources, drones that automate tasks for you, and teleporters that teleport you around the map.
        </p>
    <h3>The World</h3>
        <p>
            Outside the farm, there are nine different areas to unlock and explore.
            Each area has more slimes than you can bring back to your farm, and raise.
            They all have their own unique theme, slimes, and secrets to explore.
            One of the things you can find around are the Gordo Slimes.
            You interact with them by feeding them until they explode and provide you with a key.
            Keys give you access to these new areas.
        </p>
	<h2>The Loop</h2>
		<p>
            Putting that all together, what does that look like for the gameplay loop?
            It's very well put together, allowing progression to feel natural and fun.
            Every new slime you get gives you progressively more money, but there are mechanics in place that keep earlier slimes worth something.
            The more plorts you turn in, they decrease in value.
            This prevents people from corralling one type of slime, as it'll eventually result in no money being made.
            To supplement this, you can combine two slimes together by feeding a regular slime a plort.
            It'll then give you both plorts when you feed it.
            This mechanic alone allows for thousands of different slime combinations, and ways to organize and re-arrange your farm.
		</p>
        <p>
            Exploring the world after getting a few upgrades makes you feel pretty powerful, too.
            Occasionally, I would run around in circles instead of doing anything, simply because the movement was so fast, and flowy.
            Attempting to find all the treasures, and hidden areas gives you a sense of exploration, allowing this massive world to have so much charm.
            Going out to explore the world, and coming back to min-max my farm provided an exciting gameplay loop.
        </p>
	<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
		<p>
            Overall, I found the game to be one of the best I've played.
            A topic I didn't touch on because I didn't want to spoiler it was the story.
            Even if the gameplay wasn't as good as it is, I think the story has a story that people need to hear.
            The end of the game, and the story, made me cry.
            Compared to the expectations of games these days, Slime Rancher was a short and sweet experience, well worth your time and bones.
		</p>
	<h2>Completion Record</h2>
		<p>
            If it weren't for three achievements, you would end up completing this game simply by playing it.
            These last three achievements are bad by any means, but they aren't a part of the core gameplay experience.
            They're time trial modes, where you're tasked with making a certain amount of money within a small timeframe.
            I had to do some research to complete these, as I had no idea how it was possible to accomplish them.
            They won't take you long to figure out, nor will the entire game take you to complete.
            I wish the game had more content to complete, so that alone should tell you it's worth a completionist look.
