	<h2>Why Zuma's Revenge?</h2>
		<p>
            Zuma is another game that I never got to as a child.
			We had this game, but it was more of a game that my grandma enjoyed.
			I was always scared to open Zuma Deluxe and Zuma's Revenge because I wanted to avoid ruining her save file.
		</p>
	<h2>The UI & Theme</h2>
		<p>
            You're met with the signature PopCap loading screen, profile creator, and basic UI.
			It's always comforting every time you load up one of their games.
			Short and sweet, you have your adventure mode, time trial mode, and challenge mode.
			It has an obvious Aztec theme that's either going over my head, or is lightly offensive, or both.
		</p>
	<h2>The Gameplay</h2>
		<p>
			As with other PopCap games, the premise is basic, but I feel this one was more well done.
			You start in a usually static position, and given two coloured balls.
			You can shoot or switch between the two balls.
			The goal is to shoot one of the coloured balls at a set of two or more of the same coloured balls going down a set path.
			The objective is to stop the entire chain of balls from getting to the end by making these combos.
			Again, simple premise, but things can get hectic.
		</p>
	<h2>The Loop</h2>
		<p>
            The game will mix things up from time to time.
			In some maps, you're allowed to jump between a couple of points.
			In other maps, you can move your frog around a fixed path.
			They'll also put points and other power ups outside the map, and you need to craft a window of balls to get to them.
		</p>
		<p>
			Every so often, there's a boss you need to fight.
			It mixes in the elements from the game, and some other mechanics.
			The result is you playing the original element to initiate the next element, thus damaging the boss.
			They're fun, and engaging.
			Some are decently hard, too.
			Towards the end of the game, things can get brutally difficult.
			Things move so fast, and there are so many colours that you have to think seemingly as fast as you do in an RTS.
		</p>
	<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
		<p>
            Overall, I had a fun time beating this game.
			With a lot of PopCap games, it's random how well you're going to do, but there's also some skill involved.
			I'm excited to complete this game at some point.
