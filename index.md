## About
Thank you for taking the time to check out my website. I don't expect anyone to find this, it'll mostly serve as a way for me to link things to friends instead of screenshotting my notes. It'll also be an extension of my [Backloggery](https://www.backloggery.com/QueenRaven29), since I'm limited in how much I can type there.
