# Void's Archive

## About
Thank you for taking the time to check out my website. I don't expect anyone to find this, it'll mostly serve as a way for me to link things to friends instead of screenshotting my notes. 

## Groups
- [Video Games](./VideoGames/videogame-index) - [Backloggery](https://www.backloggery.com/QueenRaven29)
    
An expanded look into my thoughts on the video games I've beaten or completed. Feel free to follow me on Backloggery!

- [Watched Media](./Media/media-index)
    
My current show, movie, and anime backlog. Items I've watched or plan to watch and some minor thoughts on them. 

- Music - [Rate Your Music](https://rateyourmusic.com/~voidgazer_jamie)
    
A collective list of all the music I have, or plan to get. I may or may not give my thoughts on some artists or albums. 

## To-Do List

- [ ] Homepage banner
- [ ] Subgroup banners
- [ ] Buy a custom domain to replace the GitHub link.
- [ ] Consider using a dedicated CSS and switch to HTML.
