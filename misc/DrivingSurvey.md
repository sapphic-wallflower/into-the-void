# Driving Survey - 2022-04-17

The purpose of the pseduo-survey was to see if I could find an age group where people became more and more afraid of cars. The more people I met, and the older I got, I started to notice a trend. Younger generations of poeple are become increasingly more afraid of cars. I wasn't aiming to figure out why this shift happened, just the age range in which it did.
